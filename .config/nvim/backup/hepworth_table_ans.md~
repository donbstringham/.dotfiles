|INC06265024 - Alert6279417 Remediation ran but didn't fix the issue. | The script never returned to ServiceNow.  Should have gotten output like this: `Automated Remediation Note: flow:subflow::bo_restart_windows_service(): : c:\remediation\win-service-restart.ps1 SUCCEEDED on w16999 ...` |
|INC06267144 - Alert6305226 Cdata Sync Staging Service didn't run the remediation.| An older alert rule `Create Incident from Dev - Ops Monitor with KB Article` ran and auto-acknowledged the alert so the auto-remediation was not run. |
|INC06266697 - Alert6295824 Incident ticket name associated with wrong Alert ticket.| `Alert6295824` is a group alert aggregating both `Alert6295818` and `Alert629814`.  That is why it was assigned to `Alert6295824` instead of one of the others. |
|INC06273394 - Alert6382249 No Workflow kicked off.| There was no server name(s) in the description field so ServiceNow didnâ€™t know which server(s) to run the script on. |
|INC06265179 - Alert6285493| See Image 01... |
|INC06266697 - Alert6295824 Need to know what is happening in the activity section.| **06-04-2020** Looks like multiple events from the same server `W17002` came in for different services on the server.  ServiceNow launched the remediation scripts for each service.  The alerts were then grouped together by ServiceNow because they were occurring on the same CI (`Business Objects - Staging`) **06-05-2020** Then the following day the primary alert was reopened but on a different server `W17001` which is connected to the same CI as `W17002`.  |
|INC06267161 - Alert6305181|Not sure what you are expecting here?|
|INC06268538 - Alert6330779 Expected outcome of remediation.|Looks like the script corrected the problem and the monitor clear closed both alert and incident.|
|INC06268537 - Alert6330783|Multiple alerts grouped together based on the CI.  Also, multiple services went down on the same server.|
|INC06268113 - Alert6312978 Need to know what is happening in the activity section.|Multiple services (different events) went down on the same server and alerts were combined base on the CI.|
|INC06276461 - Alert6396526 Need to know what is happening in the activity section.|The script failed but the monitor closed the alert and incident.|
|INC06276477 - Alert6396520 Appears to be remediated, but a lot of messages.|The alert was receiving multiple events thus multiple remediations.|
|INC06276479 - Alert6396594|The alert was receiving multiple events thus multiple remediations.|
|INC06268904 - Alert6348243 Remediation didn't fix the issue.|An event closed the alert before the remediation returned???|
